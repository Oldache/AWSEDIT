What is Awsedit ?
--------------
AWSEDIT is a GUI utility that lets you view and extract data from 
an AWS virtual tape file.


What is an AWS virtual tape ?
--------------------------
An AWS file is a portable virtual tape.  The format was developed and documented
although not officially by IBM.  It is used in the IBM P/390 machines, the freeware
Hercules emulator, and most of the commercial emulator products provide support as
well.  An AWS tape is a single binary file which when mounted using the correct
commands for your emulation platform appears as a real tape to the guest operating
system.  Tools also exist to import/export real tapes to virtual and to directly
create an AWS file or extract from an existing one without using a real tape drive.
Currently the most robust tools are all on MVS.

How can I create AWS files from a real tape ? 
------------------------------------------
An AWS virtual tape file can be created by using a tape drive and Tapecopy
utility that is shiped with Hercules package, an open source mainframe Ã©mulator.

Hecules package can be retrieved from <http://www.hercules-390.org/>


Are there any other similar utilities ?
---------------------------------------------------
Yes. There is Awsbrows, a windows tool that lets you only view AWS tape files.
(This progam inspired me very much. So, thank you Robson !)

Awsbrows can be downloaded from <http://www.cbttape.org/ftp/adhoc/Awsbrows.zip>

and Awsbrowse from SoftDevLabs, another windows tool

Is it possible to compile Awsedit under Windows ?
-----------------------------------------
Yes. You have to install gcc, make and gtk-win-dev before to proceed.
gcc and make are contained in the Dev-C++ IDE which I recommend. 


Has awsedit been used somewhere?
------------------------------
Yes, Awsedit was used at least by a big oil company in Algeria to recover all their archives
on tapes after Mainframe damage.
